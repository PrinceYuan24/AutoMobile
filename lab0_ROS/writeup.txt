5.
(a). 
There were no noticeable differences between the two performances, however, some other group had s-path in real car when played back 8-path in sim car, some were the opposite. We thought this was because the data (steering angle, speed) between sim car and real car were not calibrated.


(b).
The playing back trajectory did not match the trajectory we recorded before. Because the car could not exactly follow the steering angle and the speed we published.


(c).
We did both of them.

(4.1)
The figure-8 path is achieved with two circles, clockwise and counterclockwise.
We first measured the distance between two shafts, L, then used R=L/tan(delta) to get the radius of the circle. After that we got the time steps to run the path with given rate.
During the process we found that the value between real measured data and estimated data were different so we multiplied a constant number in the code.

(4.2).
First we found all the range value corresponding to intensity=10 from the Ladar data. Then find the smallest range and if this is below given threshold we set, we will publish the data with speed=0 to override.
